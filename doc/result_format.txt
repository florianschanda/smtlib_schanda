map results -> map sha1(bm_name) -> map status -> sat (s), unsat (u), error (e),
                                                  timeout (t), unknown (?)
                                        dialect -> False, True
                                        time    -> float (seconds)

# Augmentation
After processing benchmarks.p and data.p we can augment the dictionay
as follows:

map results -> map sha1(bm_name) ->
                 map status  -> AS BEFORE
                     dialect -> AS BEFORE
                     time    -> AS BEFORE
                     score   -> solved (s), unsound (u), error (e),
                                timeout (t), unknown (?)
    score_total -> map solved  -> int
                       unknown -> int
                       timeout -> int
                       error   -> int
                       unsound -> int
    score_average -> map solved  -> percent
                         unknown -> percent
                         timeout -> percent
                         error   -> percent
                         unsound -> percent
    dialect_total -> int
    participated -> False, True

# Totals
A final map can be created from all the augmented summaries:

map score_total -> map solved  -> int
                       unknown -> int
                       timeout -> int
                       error   -> int
                       unsound -> int
    score_average -> map solved  -> average of averages
                         unknown -> average of averages
                         timeout -> average of averages
                         error   -> average of averages
                         unsound -> average of averages
    dialect_total -> int
